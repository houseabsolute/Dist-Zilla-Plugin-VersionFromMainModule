# ABSTRACT: Set the distribution version from your main module's $VERSION

__END__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [VersionFromMainModule]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin sets the distribution version from the C<$VERSION> found in the
distribution's main module, as defined by L<Dist::Zilla>.

This plugin is useful if you want to set the C<$VERSION> in your module(s)
manually or with some sort of post-release "increment the C<$VERSION>" plugin,
rather than letting dzil add the C<$VERSION> based on a setting in the
F<dist.ini>.

=head1 CREDITS

This code is mostly the same as what Christopher J. Madsen's
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule> module does. Unfortunately, that
module is only shipped as part of a larger distribution, and that distribution
has not been updated despite the fact that it is failing tests with newer
versions of dzil.
