# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromMainModule - Set the distribution version from your main module's $VERSION

# VERSION

version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

    [VersionFromMainModule]

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin sets the distribution version from the `$VERSION` found in the
distribution's main module, as defined by [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla).

This plugin is useful if you want to set the `$VERSION` in your module(s)
manually or with some sort of post-release "increment the `$VERSION`" plugin,
rather than letting dzil add the `$VERSION` based on a setting in the
`dist.ini`.

# CREDITS

This code is mostly the same as what Christopher J. Madsen's
[Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VersionFromModule) module does. Unfortunately, that
module is only shipped as part of a larger distro, and that distro has not
been updated despite the fact that it is failing tests with newer versions of
dzil.
